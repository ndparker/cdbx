## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Supported python versions are 2.7 and 3.6+.

You also need a build environment for python C extensions (i.e. a compiler
and the python development files).

distribution package. Further, there's an api documentation, which can be found
in the docs/apidoc/ subdirectory.

The latest documentation is also available online at
